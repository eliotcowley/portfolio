# New website launched!

Welcome to my new site! I decided it was time to ditch my old Wordpress site, buckle down and learn web development so I could make my own site and customize it exactly how I want. I've always been interested in web development, but I always quit early on because I found it so gross and confusing.

After making my first "real" website, I still find web development pretty gross (*cough cough* CSS), but at least bearable since I didn't have to use Javascript. Instead, I used a framework called [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), which lets you write front-end code in C#.

I quite enjoy Blazor, since I enjoy C# and .NET. Though HTML and CSS are no less of a pain. Learning Bootstrap helped a lot because I could worry less about CSS, but even Bootstrap has a lot of things that trip me up, like layout.

<p class="image-caption">Yay, I don't have to learn Javascript.</p>

There are two hosting models in Blazor: Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor Server. I decided to go with WebAssembly, which is a static site model where the entire site is downloaded to the client on first load. So the first time accessing the site has a longer load time, but navigating the site after that is quick. (There are ways to reduce this load time, and I have this on my backlog, but decided for now it's okay.)

I also wanted to host my website in the cloud, and chose Azure mostly because Microsoft owns both Azure and Blazor, so there are more tutorials about hosting Blazor apps in Azure than other cloud providers. Also I used to work for Microsoft, so it still has a soft spot in my heart, what can I say. Azure hosts my static site for free, which is amazing.

I'm pretty happy with what I've made so far. It took a lot longer than I would've liked, since I had to learn a lot of stuff from scratch, but I'm glad I did. There were always things that I wanted to do with my Wordpress site that would've been very difficult or impossible, but I like the fact that I can do basically anything I want with this new site.

Oh, and it's responsive! Try resizing the window and see how the layout changes. Pretty neat, eh? Bootstrap makes it super easy.

Now that I have this new site, I will probably retire my [old one](https://eliotcowley.com/). I host that site with a service called Bluehost, which I chose because of its Wordpress integration, but it's not exactly cheap. For my new site, all I have to pay for is the domain, since hosting is free. I migrated over my most popular blog post from the old site, but honestly I don't think any others are really worth keeping, so I'll just export the entire site, back it up in the cloud, and call it done.

Will I make my next website using a framework like Blazor? Probably not. Like I said, I'm glad I went through the experience, but for simple sites like this, I don't think it's worth it. I could probably get away with a simple Squarespace or Google site. I just wanted to develop this myself because it's supposed to be a portfolio for my programming skills.

Maybe if I make a web app, I'll use Blazor again. I love using the [Pomodoro method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), and I've never found an app that exactly meets my needs, so maybe I'll make one myself. We'll see!

Anyway, thanks for reading, and thanks for visiting my site!
